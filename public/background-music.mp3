Create a small, silent, or very short placeholder MP3 file here. This is just to prevent the 404 error. Replace with actual licensed music. Due to limitations, I cannot generate binary files like MP3s. Please manually create a small MP3 file named 'background-music.mp3' and place it in the 'public' directory.
